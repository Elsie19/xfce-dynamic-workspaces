So `AttributeError` is how python "cheats" out of Option, because say:

```
workspace_num = None
try:
    workspace_num = self.screen.get_active_workspace().get_number()
except AttributeError:
    pass
```

If `get_active_workspace()` fails via C, `get_number()` won't exist, so AttributeError is raised.
